Revise Chapter 10: Fusion-Fission Hybrids: Practical Integration Strategies to include the following changes:

After the introduction of the concepts of true variation vs superficial variation, the description needs more clarity that the notion of true variation vs superficial variation is subjective and may change depending on the project. It depends on project-specific factors like how many variations are truly needed, and which variations need to be mutually exclusive.

You don't need to go into further details about the differences between true and superficial variation. The main goal is to bring more clarity to the chapter without introducing new content.

Do not modify other sections that do not require the relevant clarification.

Before you start writing the revised chapter, first write down a detailed outline of the changes or additions that you are going to introduce.
