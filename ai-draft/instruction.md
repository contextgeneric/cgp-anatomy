Based on the draft document in draft.md, help me write a hyper detailed, long, PhD level deep dive research report of the anatomy of CGP, fusion vs fission-driven development, the source of its complexities, and ways to minimize the complexities of CGP.

Your explanation should be in full sentences and avoid point forms. You should go into as much details, and also include explanation of each concept works.

Do not follow the structure and organization of the original draft. You should structure and organize the content in your own way. If there is any terms or related concepts that can be clarified, make the changes.

The concept of fusion vs fission-driven development is novel and first introduced in this document. So be sure to give proper introduction when first mentioning them.

When writing example code, try to reuse and expand on the use case and examples in the provided documents, and not come up with completely new examples.

Start your writing with an executable summary and table of content. Then draft an outline that describes the overview of each chapter and section. Avoid repeating the same content in multiple sections. Stop there for me to review before moving forward.

After you finish one chapter, stop and wait for further instruction before continue writing the remaining chapters.
