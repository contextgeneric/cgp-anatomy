Help me revise the report given in report-part-1.md.

You should improve the wordings to be more engaging and better cater it to an audience with background in Rust development and PhD in programming languages. When there are redundant sentences mentioning the same points, reduce the redundancy and mention them once.

After revising each chapter, stop and wait for further instruction.
