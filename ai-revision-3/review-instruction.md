Help me perform a thorough and detailed review the given report, and produce a full list of improvements in terms of improving the flow of content, and reducing redundant mentioning of the same points.

You should assume that the reader already have some familiarity with CGP, and don't require a full introduction of CGP concepts. Instead, the main goal is to highlight the benefits that each CGP feature brings.

You should keep the original chapter organization. You can suggest to move around sections, paragraphs, or content to improve the flow and remove duplication.

You should try to preserve all original content in draft.md, and recommend to replace the appropriate examples in report.md with the examples in draft.md.

Start your review by suggesting a new table of content, including all subsections.

After the table of content, your review should be written in full sentences and avoid point forms or table.
